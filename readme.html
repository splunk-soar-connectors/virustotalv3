<h2>Cache Flow</h2>
<p>
    If caching is enabled and whenever you run any reputation action then the output of the action will be cached in the state file of the asset for which it is run. This cache will have an expiration time and maximum length, after the expiration time you have set in asset configuration if you run the get cached entries it will clear the cache.
